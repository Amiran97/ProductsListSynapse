# ProductsListSynapse

The project is a test task for Synapse!
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Getting started with Angular 

To work with `Angular`, you need to install the `Node.js` server and the `npm` package manager if they are not on the working machine. At the same time, no special knowledge is required to work with NodeJS and npm. You can use the [node.js installer to install](https://nodejs.org/en/). It will also install npm along with the server.

## Installing the Angular CLI

To compile the application, we will use the Angular CLI framework. Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application and compile it. Angular CLI is distributed as an npm package, so you must first install it in order to use it. To install the Angular CLI, open the console/command line and run the following command in it: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Download or clone a project

Use the console/command line or IDE to clone the repository. You can also download the ZIP archive of the project from GitHub.

## Installing packages. package.json
